Commands: 

docker --version
docker ps --> list running containers

docker ps -a --> List All containers which are even stopped....

docker images  --> list of docker images...


docker run -d -p 8080:80 -p 8082:443 dockersamples/static-site
where 8080 is host port
where 80 --> container port...So to access the static application type http://localhost:8080

Basically when you run the docker with "docker run -d -p 8080:80 -p 8082:443 dockersamples/static-site", this acts like a 
temp storage...means the data will be deleted once the docker gets stopped....

Run the docker with mounting the volume.... 


To stop the docker 

docker stop

to delete the docker 

docker delete
